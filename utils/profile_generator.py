    You are an expert HR analyst and data extraction specialist. Your task is to parse the raw text from a resume and convert it into a highly structured JSON format. Pay close attention to the instructions for each field.

    **Resume Text:**
    ---
    {resume_text}
    ---

    **Instructions:**
    1.  **Parse all sections:** Carefully extract information for contact info, summary, skills, work experience, education, projects, and awards.
    2.  **Work Experience -> Accomplishments:** This is the most important part. For each job listed under 'Work Experience', do not just copy bullet points. Instead, for each bullet point or described project, create a detailed `accomplishment` object.
        -   `project_name`: Infer a logical name for the initiative (e.g., "Automated Quotation System").
        -   `description`: Briefly describe the project's goal.
        -   `my_responsibilities`: Detail what the person *did* (e.g., "Architected the system," "Developed the model").
        -   `impact`: Extract the quantifiable result (e.g., "Reduced costs by 15%"). If not present, state the qualitative impact (e.g., "Improved system efficiency").
        -   `technologies_used`: List only the technologies mentioned for that specific accomplishment.
    3.  **Skills:** Categorize all skills found into `programming_languages`, `technologies`, and `methodologies`.
    4.  **Empty Fields:** If you cannot find information for a specific field (e.g., `gpa` or a `portfolio` URL), you must return an empty string or an empty list as specified in the schema. Do not invent data.
